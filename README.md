Moocker
=======

A web app that indexes MOOCs, and will enable users to create and save a learning plan of their very own.

Nothing has been uploaded to the repo yet as I've only written the webscrapers so far. I'll upload these shortly.

The site itself is being developed using Flask (and so Python) - but Im still learning to use this framework. 

Im following a turorial at http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world 
which is very good and I can highly recommend it. The end point is a microblogging site, so I'll need to do a bit of
conversion to apply that to Moocker.

Learning learning all the time...
